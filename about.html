            <h2>Gnar meets you where you are.
            </h2>
            <p>Whether you're starting with an idea or have a fully developed spec, we're on it. We immerse ourselves
                into teams when it's appropriate, or simply manage discrete aspects of a project if that's what you
                need. And everything in between.

            <h3>We discover.
            </h3>
            <p>We love listening to a client's product vision and collaborating on how to make it a reality. Here's when
                we learn about your goals, talk about any challenges and opportunities, and work with you on an initial
                feature list.

            <p>What does the user's journey look like? Gnar is ready to chart that course by drawing on our deep product
                development experience to define and build flows. Then it's onto prototyping, testing, and learning what
                will make a great user experience.

            <h3>We design.

            <p>We look broadly at the product's features and determine how to prioritize them. Then we ensure that the
                design embodies your brand and is a delight for your customers to use.

            <p>Time to put the pieces together and get ready to share your vision with your users. We implement the
                design, launch the product to market, and iterate as new features are released.

            <p>We love sending our work out into the world, but our job doesn't end there. We help you maintain your
                product, and once it's in use, identify areas where it could be better. We also do a comprehensive
                transfer of information to your internal team, so every detail is at your fingertips.
