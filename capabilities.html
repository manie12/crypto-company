            <h1> How to turn your vision <span>into code.</span> </h1>

        </div>
        <div class="how__to2">
            <p> Whether you’re starting with an idea or have a fully-developed spec, we’re on it. We immerse ourselves
                into
                your teams when it’s appropriate...or simply manage discrete aspects of a project if that’s what you
                need.
                And everything in between.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="how__to3">
            <h3>Research & Discovery
            </h3>
            <p>We love listening to a client’s product vision and collaborating on how to make it a reality. Here’s when
                we learn about your goals, talk about any challenges and opportunities, and work with you on an initial
                feature list.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="how__to4">
            <h3>Design & User Testing
            </h3>
            <p>We look broadly at the product’s features and determine how to prioritize them. Then we ensure that the
                design embodies your brand and is a delight for your customers to see and use.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="how__to5">
            <h3>User Stories & Wireframes
            </h3>
            <p>What does the user’s journey look like? Gnar is ready to chart that course by drawing on our deep product
                development experience to define and build flows. Then it’s on to prototyping, testing, and learning
                what will make a great user experience.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="how__to6">
            <h3>Build & Deployment
            </h3>
            <p>Time to put the pieces together and get ready to share your vision with your users. We implement the
                design, launch the product to market, and iterate as new features are released.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="how__to7">
            <h3>Maintenance & Optimization
            </h3>
            <p>We love sending our work out into the world, but our job doesn’t end there. We help you maintain your
                product, and once it’s in use, identify areas where it could be better. We also do a comprehensive
                transfer of information to your internal team, so every detail is at your fingertips.

            With a market saturated with content management systems, e-commerce platforms, communication
            services, and
            frameworks, we prefer to take a more consultative approach. <br> <br>
            Rather than shoehorning you into a certain platform, we spend time truly understanding your goals inside and
            out, then customize a solution that will scale as you grow. <br> <br>
            In other words, we don’t try to fit you into something off the rack. We’re about tailoring a one-of-a-kind
            suit, handmade to meet your unique needs.
